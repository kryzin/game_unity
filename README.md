The main premise of the game is to keep the Cat alive. :)

## what is going on?

If you choose the wrong icon, you lose a point and the Cat gets angry. Depending on the difficulty the timer gets shorter and you get fewer chances to make mistakes.


Maybe: some achievements unlock different colors of the Cat.
